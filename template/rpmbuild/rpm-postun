## Enter a post-uninstall script for the RPM if required. This is run after the RPM is uninstalled
#
# Note - When the last version of a package is erased, its %preun and %postun scripts will be passed an argument equal to 0 otherwise an argument of 1 (or more depending on how many versions are installed) will be passed
#
# This can be helpful when writing scripts that should only run when you are completely removing the package.
# For example if you only wanted to run the script if the package was being removed add the following to the top of the script
#
# e.g if [ $1 -gt 0 ]
#     then
#       exit 0
#     fi

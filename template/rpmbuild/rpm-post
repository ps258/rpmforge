## Enter a post-install script for the RPM if required. This is run after the RPM is installed
#
# Note - When the first version of a package is installed, its %pre and %post scripts will be passed an argument equal to 1 otherwise an argument of 2 (or more depending on how many versions are installed) will be passed
#
# This can be helpful when writing scripts that should only run on first install.
# For example if you only wanted to run the script if the package was being installed for the first time add the following to the top of the script
#
# e.g if [ $1 -gt 1 ]
#     then
#       exit 0
#     fi

## Enter a pre-install script for the RPM if required. This is run before the RPM is installed
#
# Note - When the first version of a package is installed, its %pre and %post scripts will be passed an argument equal to 1 otherwise an argument of 2 (or more depending on how many versions are installed) will be passed
#
# This can be helpful when writing scripts that should only run on first install for example
#
# e.g if [ $1 -gt 1 ]
#     then
#       exit 0
#     fi

# Provide a list of all files and their permissions

# Example 1
# %defattr(<file mode>,<user>,<group>,<dir mode>)
# This sets default file permissions for all files to use the permissions currently set in src/* and the owner to be user and group

# Example 2
# %attr(644,user,group) /tmp/testfile
# This sets file permissions for /tmp/testfile to be 644 and the owner to be the specified user and group

# If not setting individual permissions then list the package files as stored in the src/ directory. Omit the src directory in the path.
# e.g. /tmp/testapp/*
# These will get the default permissions specified with the %defattr satement
